# Example Content

To successfully run this example, you must provide information to access the
confluence API. To make that part easier, I have included a template. Copy
`terraform.template.tfvars` to `terraform.tfvars` and edit its values. Terraform
will load this file automatically when you run `terraform apply`.

This example will generate pet names and create a confluence page listing those
pet names.
